Problem Statement
Manual calculation of student performance is time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers often need a quick way to enter student marks, calculate averages, and identify weak or high-performing students. This project provides an automated system that performs these tasks using rule-based logic without any machine learning.

Scope of the Project
The system allows adding student records, calculating average marks, assigning performance categories (High/Medium/Low), and generating reports. This is a console-based Java application and does not include a database or machine learning model.

Target Users
- Teachers  
- Tutors  
- Academic coordinators  
- Anyone needing quick student performance evaluation

High-Level Features
- Add new students  
- Enter marks for multiple subjects  
- Automatically compute average  
- Automatic performance categorization  
- Show all student reports  
- Show weak students (Low category)  
- Show toppers (High category)
