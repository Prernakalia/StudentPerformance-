# Student Performance Management System 

A simple Java console-based application that manages student records, computes average marks, and categorizes performance using rule-based logic (High / Medium / Low).  
This project was built as part of the "Build Your Own Project" flipped course.

Features
- Add student details  
- Enter marks for multiple subjects  
- Automatically compute average  
- Categorize performance:
  - High → avg ≥ 75  
  - Medium → 50 ≤ avg < 75  
  - Low → avg < 50  
- View:
  - All student reports  
  - Weak students  
  - Toppers  
- Input validation for safe execution
